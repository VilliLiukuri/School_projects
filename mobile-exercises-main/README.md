I found the course to be quite enjoyable overall. The materials provided were appropriately challenging, and I appreciated how the assignments were designed to encourage me to learn basic concepts and skills on my own each time. Despite the fact that the course was conducted through distance learning, I felt that the materials were still engaging and well-suited to this format.

The workload for the course was also reasonable, in my opinion. I had originally hoped to complete the assignments up to the passing threshold and then continue from there if I had enough time, but unfortunately, my busy work and life schedule limited the amount of time I had available. As a result, I ultimately had to settle for a grade of 1.

Overall, though, I am still very glad that I complete the course. The challenging materials and assignments really pushed me to learn and grow, and I feel that I gained a lot from the experience.
